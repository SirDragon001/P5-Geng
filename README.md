Welcome to my GENCG Project

This was a Module at the HSLU in the third semester to explore digital Art who works on the principle of recuring.
I was not that use to document my progress by this point which led to a lack there off for the first part.
The final two parts, Shapes05 & Shapes 06, I really tried to document what I was doing.
I hope if someone takes a look at those. He'll be able to learn some way from it. ^^
